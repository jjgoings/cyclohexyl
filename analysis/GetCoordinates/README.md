Writes the data out to a table in a Word file, which can then be formatted as desired.

Note the file "template.docx" has a table style already defined so that the output tables are printed as desired. If this document does not exist, or if it does not have the table defined, then you must either re-create the file and table style or else remove it from the python script (and default to one of Word's built-in templates).
