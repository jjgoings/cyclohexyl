# cyclohexyl 
*ab initio* electrochemical calculations on mono-, di-, and tri-BIP cyclohexylimines for bioinspired proton relays

Using `scale=0.9631` to fit triBIP E4PT C=NH+ stretch to experiment

amide-monoBIP is not a cyclohexyl substituent, but included as a reference for the overall oxidation.
unsub-monoBIP is not a cyclohexyl substituent, but included as a reference for the overall oxidation.
